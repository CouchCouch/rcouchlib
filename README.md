# rcouchlib
A library of different functions and data structures written in C++ by me, Ryan Couchman

## Implemented:
### lists:
 - treelist: a binary search tree list (more of a set)
### sorts:
 - bubblesort: bubble sort sorting algorithm
 - quicksort: the quick sort sorting algorithm

## To Be Implemented
 - my own version of the vector library for use in sorting algorithms
 - more sorting algorithms
 - more lists
 - maps
 - graphs
 - stacks
 - queues
### maybe:
 - some n-ary trees
 - a testing framework

also plan on setting up a CI once I implement some tests (and maybe  write my own testing framework)
